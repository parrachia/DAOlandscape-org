### TA / Need

For Blockchain Community – more/better awareness about dgov/dao development and what needs support.

As a DAO practitioner I am most interested in exploring the mechanics of DAOs and the "Constitutions" that set the boundaries of their operations. So perhaps some case studies / exploration of these different mechanisms would be interesting to add. – John Light, Aragon.
